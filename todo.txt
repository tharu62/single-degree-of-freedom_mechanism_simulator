0) Precise and consistent simulation of 2d object physics with realistic collisions, forces, torque, ecc.. 
    The objects are not just circles, boxes and polygons but also special shapes with verteces.

1) The object of special shapes drawn on screen must be described in a .csv file with a list of verteces centered on origin 
    and not in absolute position. 
    In the same file there must be the values of initialization of the object :
        - position
        - velocity
        - acceleartion
        - mass
        - density
        - ...

2) Allow the simulation to stop and display the instance of the objects.
    This mean that the program should have a "frame by frame" mode in which time is flowing a step at at time 
    and the single step is fixed, the step update is triggered with the user input by keyboard. 
    Each step should rappresent  a complete instance of the system with energy, forces, velocities ecc.. all rappresented
    on a legend. 

3) Make an internal console for dynamic modification of single instances of the object.
